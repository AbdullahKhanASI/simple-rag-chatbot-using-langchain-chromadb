| `LLM_MODEL` | OpenAI chat model | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `PERSIST_DIR` | Vector database directory | `db` |
| `CHUNK_SIZE` | Text chunk size for processing | `1000` |
| `CHUNK_OVERLAP` | Overlap between text chunks | `200` |
| `RETRIEVAL_K` | Number of relevant chunks to retrieve | `4` |

## 🛠️ Available Commands

Use the included Makefile for easy project management:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make help` | Show all available commands |
| `make setup` | Complete project setup |
| `make install` | Install Python dependencies |

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
PDFs → PyPDFLoader → Text Splitting → OpenAI Embeddings → ChromaDB → Retrieval → GPT-4o → User
```

### Key Components

- **Document Ingestion** (`ingest.py`): Processes PDFs and creates vector embeddings
- **Chat Interface** (`chat.py`): Provides conversational interface with source citations
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for fast similarity search
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT models for response generation

```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Document Types

Extend `ingest.py` to support additional formats:

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader, CSVLoader

# Add support for text files
if file_path.suffix == '.txt':
    loader = TextLoader(str(file_path))
elif file_path.suffix == '.csv':
    loader = CSVLoader(str(file_path))
```

### Using Local Embeddings

Switch to local embeddings for enhanced privacy:

```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(
    model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
)
```

### Custom Chunking Strategies

Modify text splitting parameters in `ingest.py`:

```python
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1500,        # Larger chunks for more context
    chunk_overlap=300,      # More overlap for better continuity
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", " ", ""]
)
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing required environment variables"**
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Add your OpenAI API key

**"Database directory not found"**
- Run document ingestion first: `make ingest`

**"No documents found"**
- Add PDF files to the `docs/` folder
- Re-run ingestion: `make ingest`

**Import/dependency errors**
- Activate virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**OpenAI API errors**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your OpenAI account has sufficient credits
- Ensure your API key has the correct permissions

### Getting Help

- Check the detailed documentation in `CLAUDE.md`
- Review log files: `ingest.log` and `chat.log`
- Open an issue on GitHub if you encounter bugs

## 📊 Performance

- **Ingestion Speed**: ~5 PDFs processed in under 2 minutes
- **Query Response**: Under 3 seconds per question
- **Memory Usage**: Less than 1GB RAM for typical document sets
- **Storage**: Approximately 10MB per 100 pages of PDFs

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
